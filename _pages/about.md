I have a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) College of Science (Manila, Philippines). I took up Advanced Microbiology and Microbial Physiology, Genetics and Biotechnology, as well as Mycology and Biology of Myxomycetes, Phycology, and Advanced Immunology units from the UST Graduate School, through its MS Microbiology program. I am currently looking into taking up Master of Statistics at the University of Northern Philippines College of Arts and Sciences (Vigan City) and learning more about and developing skills in Data Science in my pathway to becoming a Data Scientist focused in the field of Microbiological Research.
