I have a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) College of Science (Manila, Philippines). I took up Advanced Microbiology, Microbial Physiology, Genetics, and Biotechnology, Mycology, Biology of Myxomycetes, Phycology, and Advanced Immunology units from the UST Graduate School, through its MS Microbiology program. I am currently looking into learning more about and developing skills in Data Science for Microbiological Research.
