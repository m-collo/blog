Which I would write about when I get around to it. I also wrote about learning from the Data Professor’s Drug Discovery and Krish Naik’s Air Quality Index data science projects (Ken Jee’s too), though I haven’t yet, as I try to pursue my own projects. I mentioned back then that I already had a couple of ideas. One of those ideas I had actually had to do with the COVID-19 cases dataset we had here in my area, which was made publicly available through Facebook for transparent information dissemination from the government. I was thinking of creating an interactive graphic visualization of the available data. Though I haven’t actually gotten started with the project yet, I recently discovered that there have also been studies conducted on the topic here in the Philippines. Last 23rd and 24th of November, 2021, the Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) School of Quantitative Sciences, in partnership with my alma mater, the University of Santo Tomas (UST) College of Science, virtually held the 5th Innovation and Analytics Conference &amp;amp; Exhibition (IACE 2021). Its theme revolved around the main topic of big data, specifically “What’s Next? Surfing the Big Data Waves.” I learned about the conference late so I was not able to register for it. I was only able to watch the live stream through Facebook (1, 2). But I was also able to download their book of abstracts that they made publicly available so I will be talking about the data science studies conducted on the COVID-19 pandemic based on the abstracts I read. One of the presentations in the Mathematics section during the virtual conference (which I was not able to watch since it was presented through Zoom rooms), presented by a researcher from my former university’s Research Center for the Natural and Applied Sciences, was “The UST CoV-2 Model for the COVID-19 Pandemic in Metro Manila,” in which a prediction model was developed through modification of MIT’s (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) DELPHI epidemiological model. Fixed parameters were adjusted and the function for government response was replaced. They then extended their developed model to include vaccination effects, and susceptibility was further divided into high risk and low risk. High risk and low risk were also differentiated among the vaccinated. A further undergraduate study in UST, under the guidance of the same researcher as before, tested for the “Feasibility of Markov Chain Modelling Techniques for COVID-19 Cases Prediction in the Philippines” (Watch at 1:53:43). They first identified the average infection, recovery, and death rates of COVID-19, obtained from the Department of Health (DOH) official website (and optimized using SciPy). They then determined the accuracy of Markov Chains for COVID-19 cases production by comparing it to the real-time local data they obtained. They used a four-state Markov chain process. So far they only have partial results that “showed promise on some occasions” and are still conducting further testing. Another UST undergraduate study focused on analyzing the “sentiment” of people on COVID-19 vaccination programs (Watch at 2:03:56). They conducted a survey to do this. Some of the things they discovered is that people were willing to be vaccinated but the vaccination program was not made immediately available to the public since the Philippines’ COVID-19 Inter-Agency Task Force prioritized the frontliners, the elderly population, and those with comorbidities first. To the few that refused vaccination, they were influenced by social media and their religious beliefs. The presentations for these two studies are available in the UST College of Science Department of Mathematics and Physics Facebook page. Under the Statistics section, a study on the Spatio-Temporal Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Baguio was presented by a researcher from the University of Philippines and Nueva Vizcaya State University. They investigated the geographic information system maps of cumulative incidence rates and used the Moran’s index to determine significant spatial autocorrelations then hotspot analysis using the Getis-Ord GI* and Local Moran’s I of QGIS, confirming with cluster and outlier analysis. Another researcher from UP Baguio conducted A Social Network Analysis of COVID-19 Transmission, this time, in Rosales, Pangasinan, using R’s igraph package to create network graphs, focusing on the node (which represented the infected individuals) and the edge (the directed links from sources to target patients) attributes, applying degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Researchers from the Universiti Teknologi MARA Seremban studied “The Presence of Chaos Theory in Data Analytic of COVID-19 Outbreak,” specifically chaotic behavior, using the Largest Lyapunov Exponent. They used the chaos indicator tools, Logistic Map, to create a daily forecast of cases until 2023 and used Linear Regression and Mean Square Error to verify its accuracy. Another study from the Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, although it is far from my data science project idea’s focus, analyzed stock return volatility during the pandemic in Malaysia and China. Researchers from the Universiti Utara Malaysia, meanwhile, conducted A Survival Analysis for the Bah Cluster in Malaysia, using Kaplan Meier Estimator and K-Log rank test to determine its regional and cluster-based variability in survivorship. They also estimated the relative risk of this cluster by calculating SMR. Based on the SMR value they obtained, they then developed disease mapping to visualize and differentiate the high and low risks in the Bah cluster. Under the Operational Research section, another group of researchers at the university focused on the Mathematical Modelling of Physical Distancing Policy for Mass Gathering Events to offer a solution. They bibliometrically analyzed (using the Bibliometrix R package) the research development in the application of the optimization and simulation methods to address COVID-19 physical distancing policy (OSPhyD). They also created an optimum classroom/student seat layout (constrained by physical distancing due to the pandemic) based on the circle packing problem solution. A knapsack optimization/binary knapsack/binary integer programming model was also created in another university study, using Lingo 12.0 to maximize food baskets’ total weight with a maximum budget/budget restriction and help in food distribution to families during the pandemic. Based on the conference’s book of abstracts, data analysis was also conducted on other diseases such as measles and dengue and also applied in the field of aquatic toxicology/water treatment just like in Krish Naik’s Air Quality Index data science project, as well as in the field of teaching. One of the conference’s keynote speakers, from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, also talked about the data analytics that their university conducts, which includes disease outbreak and COVID-19 prediction, at the beginning of the conference, in her speech entitled “Surfing the Big Data Waves: Challenges, Deep Learning Approaches and Implementation Process Framework” (Watch at 3:18:21). She talked about where and how they collected COVID-19 data and how they stored the collected data, proposing a future database as well. They have a descriptive analysis dashboard where they visualized the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, which is similar to what I’m aiming to do for my COVID-19 data science project idea. They tested five different prediction models for accuracy (SIR, system dynamics, curve-fitting, deep learning, and ARIMA) and found the curve-fitting model to be the most accurate so far, however, this was constrained by the low number of data they had to test (only 2 months of data). Last November 26, 2021 in the meantime, the UST College of Science Department of Mathematics and Physics held what is jointly the 26th Rev. Fr. Ciriaco Pedrosa, O.P. Memorial Lecture Series and the 8th International Symposium on Math and Physics. In this lecture series and symposium, a fellow of OCTAResearch that has been studying the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines (as well as professor of the biological sciences at UST) presented his lecture entitled “The Science and Art of Modeling Hospital Utilization in the NCR” (Watch at 49:34). I was able to watch his lecture live through the department’s Facebook page. He talked about utilizing basic spreadsheet modeling with Excel due to the shortcomings of DOH data and the need to use the most basic modeling for its simplicity. Lastly, I attended the webinar “Up-To-Date with Microbiology” held by the Standing Committee on Research Exchange (SCORE) of San Beda University’s (Manila) Social Action Medical Students Association (SAMA), in partnership with the Philippine Society for Microbiology, Inc. and the American Society for Microbiology, last December 11th, 2021. The lectures included the implication of secondary bacterial infections to COVID-19 patients (Watch at 31:50) and “Emerging Therapeutic Interventions on COVID-19” (Watch at 1:26:15). In particular, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning was discussed as one “way forward in re-thinking interventions and innovations,” as well as drug development through virtual reality and “interactive molecular dynamics simulations.” These simulations are said to “allow researchers to step inside SARS-CoV-2 enzymes and visualize molecules binding to them.” The lecture speaker also introduced the ACCELER8 Project Team or “Advancing Antivirals thru Combined Computational Design and Emerging Omics to Leverage Repurposed and Natural Drugs for SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics,” which is a collaboration between the University of the Philippines Manila, De La Salle University Manila, and the Philippine Genome Center Mindanao. They are currently in the in vitro testing stage of their drug candidates. While I was considering delving into web development earlier last year, I found this COVID-19 tracker developed by a former classmate of my aunt in college. She told me about him and the free trainings being provided by our country’s Department of Information and Communications Technology, particularly on web development and graphic design, and I remember seeing the tracker he made which I think was also kind of what gave me inspiration for my idea for a COVID-19 data science project. Though that tracker records cases from all over the world and not just in the Philippines, mine is kind of like a COVID-19 cases visualizer for our area based on all the data I’ve been seeing that has been made available. The last webinar I attended last year on the topic of COVID-19 was by the Philippine Society for Lactic Acid Bacteria, Inc. in cooperation with the University of the Philippines Los Baños and Yakult Phils. The theme was “Lactic Acid Bacteria and COVID-19 Promising Interventions for the New Normal” and it featured a professor from Universitas Gadjah Mada Yogyakarta, Indonesia, who was also the President of the Asian Federation for Lactic Acid Bacteria Societies, along with the Founding President, a Professor Emeritus of Hokkaido University, Japan. I also took the opportunity to become a member (for free) of the Philippine Society and had the oathtaking after the webinar and the Society’s business meeting. I had been planning to attend two more webinars on COVID-19 this year, one entitled “Microbiomes and their Impact on Viral Infections: An Overview” and the other “New Year, New Surge: The Omicron of 2022,” but I was not able to. Also, I learned that my former college will be offering a new Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Analytics program starting this year when I attended our alumni general assembly last September 18, 2021. I was actually surprised when I learned about it, considering that I had just rediscovered my interest in Data Science by then and had been planning on segueing my career onto that path through a Master of Statistics program in a university here where I am now. On that topic, I also recently had the thought, why not continue the Data Science Specialization being offered by Johns Hopkins University at Coursera? But then I remembered that I would have to dive right into R programming and I’m overcome by the feeling of being overwhelmed again. For some reason, I decided to look through any other courses that might be offered by Johns Hopkins University since I remembered that the Data Science courses were taught by Biostatistics professors at Bloomberg School of Public Health. That’s when I found the Math courses being offered (Algebra, Pre-calculus, Calculus) and that’s when I had the thought to brush up on my Math skills as the Data Professor mentioned that it was one of the skills important in the field of data science (See “What do you need to become a data scientist?” in my Life Scientists’ Quick Introduction to Data Science post). So now I am currently taking Johns Hopkins’ Algebra: Elementary to Advance Specialization in Coursera. I’m hoping to finish calculus by the time the academic year 2022-2033 starts for the Master of Statistics program.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Life Scientists’ Quick Introduction to Data Science</title><link href="https://melizzacollo.github.io/blog/data-science-courses/2021/09/05/Intro-to-Data-Science.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Life Scientists’ Quick Introduction to Data Science" /><published>2021-09-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://melizzacollo.github.io/blog/data-science-courses/2021/09/05/Intro-to-Data-Science</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Data-Science-Courses" /><summary type="html">Updated February 3, 2022: Added video “My journey into data science”</summary></entry></feed>
