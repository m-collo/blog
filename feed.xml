As someone who has always been interested in the medical field of the life sciences, I was intrigued at the fact that the course was being offered through Johns Hopkins University by a group of professors of Biostatistics at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Public health was a field of interest of mine. The word biostatistics also brought to mind memories of doing well and enjoying the subject during college and my graduate studies. But as I finished the course and continued on with the “Data Science Specialization: R Programming” course (which I didn’t finish), I felt bombarded with the terms “big data” and “programming” without having a clear understanding yet of what I could potentially do in the field of data science.</summary></entry></feed>
