            "title": "Life Scientists' Quick Introduction to Data Science",
            "content": "I stumbled upon data science in 2015 through “The Data Scientist’s Toolbox” course offered through Coursera. As someone who has always been interested in the medical field of the life sciences, I was intrigued at the fact that the course was being offered through Johns Hopkins University by a group of professors of Biostatistics at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Public health was a field of interest of mine. The word biostatistics also brought to mind memories of doing well and enjoying the subject during college and my graduate studies. But as I finished the course and continued on with the “Data Science Specialization: R Programming” course (which I didn’t finish), I felt bombarded with the terms “big data” and “programming” without having a clear understanding yet of what I could potentially do in the field of data science. . Fast forward to 6 years later (after detouring into the field of online writing and tutoring freelance work), I stumbled upon data science again when I found out that a Master of Statistics degree was being offered at a university in the area I moved to 3 years ago (and currently living in). And of course, it was a master’s study that required thesis work. It made me think about what I could do with statistics in the field of microbiology, and then the first thing I did was to look up the words “statistics in microbiology” on YouTube. After scrolling through the available media, I came upon an interview conducted by codebasics with the Data Professor, in the video called “Data Science in Biology How a biologist became a data scientist.” That was the start of my understanding of what I could do as a data scientist in the field of microbiology. . In this video, we are having a conversation with Chanin who is a biologist as well as a data scientist. He will discuss how he became a data scientist by learning all required skills on his own (i.e. self-taught learning) and also discuss some of the applications of data science in the field of biology. He has a great piece of advice for people who are in the biology field and want to apply data science in their field. . In this video, Chanin Nantasenamat, Ph.D. AKA the Data Professor share experiences on how he transitioned from a biologist to becoming a data scientist (bioinformatician) working in bioinformatics. . I am writing this post because I basically want to share the sort of “introductory course” I took into understanding data science as a life scientist (particularly a microbiologist). It started with the video of the Data Professor talking about how he became a data scientist. From him I learned how data science can be applied in the fields of Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine through his research work in finding cures for diseases or novel drugs: by looking at specific pathological proteins and then at compounds and small molecules that will interact with and modulate those proteins. . He started out by using the graphical user interface (GUI) software called WEKA developed by a team from the University of Waikato, but he later realized that developing his own software, models, and data mining workflow (by learning coding and programming languages) helped to speed up his work by a hundred or even a thousandfold. . So, what do you need to become a data scientist? . In his “How to Become a Data Scientist (Learning Path and Skill Sets Needed)” video, the Data Professor outlines the 8 major concepts/framework/skillsets/topics that he believes are the key (though stressing that this is only a summary or a bird’s eye view of the data science landscape). . What is Data Science? How can you Learn Data Science? How Can You Become a Data Scientist? What is the Learning Path and Roadmap for Learning Data Science? In this video, I discuss about 8 important skill sets that all Data Scientists should know about. The Infographic that I will use in this video can be used as a Roadmap for Beginners to Learn Data Science and Get Started in Data Science. . . Seeing this overview of the Data Science Landscape by the Data Professor helped me to connect the dots between Data (or Big Data), Programming, as well as Statistics (or Biostatistics). It makes me feel happy seeing the Master of Statistics degree knowing my interest in biostatistics before and just with computers in general. I have an idea now on how to transition into Data Science by applying statistics into microbiology, also by learning more about programming languages such as R, pre-processing and visualizing data, topics that I’ve heard before such as machine learning, and other topics that I’ve also been interested on such as software engineering, development and web development, brushing up my math, and also just by applying my writing skills, research, and being creative. . Next comes the question: “To PhD or not to PhD?” By then, it was no question to me that I really wanted to pursue the Master of Statistics degree I found from a university. What was a question to me though was whether I wanted to continue teaching in university or not, as I had a previous experience. Dr. Chanin Nantasenamat, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor who is also aiming for Professorship at the university he was in (as he mentioned in his interview with codebasics). Because of his data science efforts, a Center of Data Mining and Biomedical Informatics was established at the university he works in. My science dream has always been to focus in the field of research, and I dreamed that I wanted to work on research at UNP and maybe even help establish a research center focused on data science in the university too. I knew that a stepping stone into that direction could be to become a part of the college faculty in the university, but maybe I could also simply find work in the university’s Research and Development Office. I would have to look into the kind of research being done in the university. . (I also looked into the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics, which is offering a PhD program. I learned how the foundations of data science and advanced data science are involved in it, leading to a career as a data scientist, with courses on topics such as machine learning, programming, data, algorithms, AI, computer vision, and natural language processing, and with applications on public health, or the biomedical sciences, genomics, and computational biology.) . To PhD or not to PhD, that is the question for data science. In this video, I discuss about how getting a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree helped in my journey of becoming a Biomedical Data Scientist. I will take you back to the time on how I got inspired in science and decided to begin my science career. . Another important point presented by Dr. Nantasenamat is the importance of conducting Data Science Projects, either through the academe or the industry. Having a mentor you can learn from and who can guide and support you along the way, along with colleagues and even students (or maybe interns in the business world), publishing results through journal articles, and presenting them through conferences or to clients are also some other important points. When it comes to the time you put into these projects though, time may have more structure if you work in the corporate world as opposed to working in an academic institution (as I also learned from this presentation by a Machine Learning Scientist), so it is up to you to plan wisely and to motivate yourself. It is definitely something for me to consider after previously taking up a MS program in my old university. In his video, Dr. Nantasenamat talked about his experiences doing projects while pursuing his PhD and his realization on the importance of having these projects and his experiences with them, which I learned a lot from and you can also learn more. (He also talked about how his interest in the field of science started and how this made him pursue it). . Data Science Portfolio . With data science projects also comes having a Data Science Portfolio. Dr. Nantasenamat gave some tutorials on “Building your Data Science Portfolio with GitHub” and “How to Build a Simple Portfolio Website for FREE” through GitHub as well. You can also build a blogging website to showcase your portfolio “using fastpages.” You can see this website as an example born from these tutorials. . In this video, I guide you in a step-by-step manner on setting up your Data Science portfolio using GitHub. A portfolio helps you to showcase your data science projects that will attract employers as well as allow you to archive your learned expertise in data science. . Have you ever wanted to build a portfolio website to showcase your data science and coding projects? In this video, you will learn how to build a simple portfolio website and host it for free on GitHub Pages. The website will be coded in Markdown which is a simple to use syntax that you can learn in less than 5 minutes. . Do you want to showcase your coding and data science projects? In this video, we will explore how to build a portfolio website that natively supports the display of Jupyter notebooks by using the FastPages template from the creators of fastai. This portfolio website can double as a blogging website where you can write blog posts in Markdown as well as in a Microsoft Word DOC file format. Particularly, the fastpages template can convert IPYNB, MD and DOC files to webpages and finally the website is hosted on GitHub Pages for FREE! . He also gave some “Data Science Portfolio Tips” through a discussion with other Data Science YouTubers, Dhaval (codebasics), Ken Jee and Krish Naik. They talk about the reasons why data science projects should be implemented, the benefits of doing so in freshers’ job search, the question of quantity versus quality when it comes to doing projects, their favorite projects that they have done, data science projects that can be explored on the topic of the coronavirus, where to find datasets, their favorite machine learning algorithms, recommendations for deep learning, and IDEs/coding environments they use. . In this video, I had a panel discussion about building data science portfolio with Data Science YouTube influencers Ken Jee, Krish Naik, Dhaval (codebasics). All four of us come from different countries and we bring unique perspectives on the topics discussed. . Here, I outline the points that can be taken away from discussion into four main points under the topic of the Data Science Portfolio: . Why should you implement data science projects? . You can learn a lot faster when working with examples of code and applying the technology. You will be able to internalize it much more effectively as opposed to just reading about it. Seeing the results of the model, you intuitively understand more how it works than just conceptualizing it. - Ken Jee . | You can have something to show as opposed to just taking a course and getting a certificate, for example, an actual model that works and that can predict something. You can have something tangible that you created, which means more to recruiters or managers and shows that you understand the concepts enough to apply them. - Ken Jee . | You can give yourself a mental reward. Having something like a website working in front of you can give you motivation to continue further and give you a mental boost. - Dhaval . | Having projects can denote importance to your skills such as implementation, for example, an end-to-end product that people can see what it actually does. Following the life cycle of a data science project can help you be able to explain it and be understood by a layman person. - Krish Naik . | Doing projects can also help figure out the topics that you want to learn more about. With a minimal viable product, you can also make more improvements (or versions), such as adding more features, or by modifying the algorithm. - Dr. Nantasenamat . | The essence of a master’s or graduate study is in the capstone or thesis project, so doing a master’s can give you an extended time that is spent working on projects. - Dr. Nantasenamat . | Doing projects can also help in your job search or getting an internship in a real-world industry. It can show that you have a basic knowledge of implementing projects. Writing blogs about your projects can also be a plus in your resume. - Krish Naik . | . How do you get projects? . Look for open-source projects that you can contribute to, real datasets, real problems, or real-life projects. You can go to a non-government organization. Having someone you know who has a business can also help. - Dhaval . | Choose projects that tell your own personal story, that you’re interested or passionate in, or that can be related to the work being done by the company you are applying to. Choose a subject area or domain that you can learn, explain, work on, and present, something you can talk about with the employer during the job interview or give real world examples to. - Ken Jee . | Find out the niche in a certain location. - Dhaval . | . In my case, I need to learn more about the research being done in the university I am planning to take Master of Statistics in and do research in in the future. I learned that two of the main research being done in the university is on mushrooms and aqua marine resources. In my time doing undergraduate and graduate studies in microbiology, fungi, particularly marine fungi, and marine protists were also hot topics with the microbiology professors and researchers in my old university. I also have relatives who are doing business, research, and implementation (at a different college) on mushroom production in the surrounding area. . Try to be flexible in your projects by trying out different aspects, for example, doing mini projects focused on a specific aspect. Have diversity in your projects as well, for example, by using different types of algorithms (classification, clustering, regression). - Ken Jee . | Choose and do projects based on the type of career you are targeting or your end goal. - Dhaval . | . You can look into job descriptions about what kinds of tools are used or required and try to do projects to learn more or gain experience with these tools. (Check out Ken Jee’s project on the topic.) . Try to develop your soft skills such as communication (e.g. convincing people with the novelty you are presenting or conveying it) through your projects as well. Try to do some novel tweaks to existing algorithms in your projects, such as increasing performance or improving interpretability of a model. In science, you may need to convince biologists and/or chemists of your prediction model by using features, decision trees and linear regression. Make use of the data to drive actionable, reproducible results. - Dr. Nantasenamat . | You can start with a problem, grab the data then solve it or you can start with the data. Learn to communicate the value in your project, for example to business stakeholders. What do you want to determine? to solve? Who would the analysis help? Don’t forget to document and share your work. - Ken Jee . | . Where do you find datasets? . Aside from being a part of a company that has its own internal database already, there are some 3rd-party application programming interfaces (APIs) that sell data. - Krish Naik | . However, there are also some that provide it for free such as Amazon, Yahoo, Bloomberg, Yelp, YouTube (after requesting for a token), and Google. . Web scraping is also an option and there are some tools, but there is also a grey area that can lead to some legal problems. Ken Jee suggests trying to search for the robots.txt file in websites before scraping. . | For scientists, there are peer-reviewed journals that offer higher quality data such as nature’s scientific data, MDPI’s Data, and Taylor &amp; Francis’ Big Earth Data. - Dr. Nantasenamat . | . How do you start? . You can start with regression and random forests when it comes to machine learning models. Understanding deep learning doesn’t hurt either. . | You can start with Spyder for the integrated development environment (IDE) or coding environment, as well as RStudio and Visual Studio (VS) Code. . | . And so I started with having this website and blog on GitHub and writing this blog post. I also already have a couple of my own ideas for some data science projects aside from learning from the projects that the Data Professor (Drug Discovery project), Ken Jee and Krish Naik (Air Quality Index project) have. I hope this “quick introductory course” also helps you as you jumpstart into a career path towards data science as a biologist, a microbiologist like me, even a biochemist, or someone in the field of medicine. The next step into this journey is yours to take. For me, I have planned on delving more into the Data Professor’s bioinformatics-related videos to immerse myself more into the “science” in data science. . Some other videos you can check out: .
